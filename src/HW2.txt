Challenge Version

1. The first thing that I did was read through all the files to get a sense of how this program operated and what methods I could call. Then just worked down the list implementing the different functions.

2. One thing that works and doesn't is that my code for rotation could likely have been refactored into another class file, but do to the natures of the conversions that I did, it would have been difficult to implement and not improved it all that much.

3. When I realized that I could refactor my blurs into a different class and didn't need to hard code each of them individually. I should have realized that sooner and it would have taken me a lot less time to implement.

4. I learned a lot about using Graphics2D for handling rotations and adjustment of Image size

5. I would map out what sections might be redundant so I don't end up writing the code more than once to realize I could have just made a separate class to handle it.
